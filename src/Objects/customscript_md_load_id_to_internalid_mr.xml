  <description>Created 04/2022 by MDIMKOV
this map-reduce script loads (for several object types, such as fields and scripts) the id-to-internalid pairs into the [MD Object Id To Internal Id] record type
for some objects (such as scripts, lists, record types and saved searches) this is easily done, as a saved search can be built for each of those
for others, such as custom fields, no saved search can be built, so the M/R script will just iterate potential internal IDs from 1 to 10,000 and try to get the object IDs for them; when an object ID is found, it&apos;s recorded in the [MD Object Id To Internal Id] record type
Finally the [] suitelet loads the records into the cache by using a loader function - if the value for the respective object ID is not found, the loader function performs a search on the [MD Object Id To Internal Id] record type and loads the value from there
