<suitelet scriptid="customscript_md_redirect_to_object_sl">
  <description>Created 04/2022 by MDIMKOV
this suitelet is used by Chrome bookmark apps
it redirects the user to the respective object by id (e.g. customscript_xxx)
the advantage is that the internal IDs are resolved durng runtime, allowing for easily moving the objects between different environments
the script checks first if the internal id is not passed anyways, so that the user can be immediately redirected (e.g. to record with id=123)
if not, it checks if the respective cache has the internal id for the object id passed
if not, the user is just being redirected to the respective list of objects (e.g. list of fields or scripts etc.)
note that a M/R script [md_load_id_to_internalid_mr.js] is also used to load the respective id-internalid pairs
